# 💧 AquaSmart – AI-Powered Marketing Video | Future Intern Project

## 🎯 Project Overview

This project was completed as part of my Prompt Engineering Internship at **Future Intern**. The goal of **Task 1** was to create a short marketing video using **AI-generated images** and **scripted text** to promote a product.

I chose to showcase **AquaSmart**, a smart water bottle that tracks hydration, sends reminders, and helps users build healthier habits.

“It tracks your water intake, reminds you when to drink, and keeps your water at the perfect temperature.”
(Image: Phone app connected to the bottle showing hydration status)

“With LED glow reminders, Bluetooth syncing, and a 24-hour cold/12-hour hot guarantee — staying hydrated has never been easier.”
